## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size



### Links

- Live Site URL: [live site URL](https://costelloeward.github.io/stats-card/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Working with flex and semantic html together.
Picture element can contain reponsive images as an alternative to CSS. It can not be used as a container for mix-blend-mode, these needs a div to be set as a container for background colour.


### Continued development

Future focus on what semantic html elements can and can't do: where divs may still be needed.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_mix-blend-mode.asp) - This helped me understand the mix-blend-mode rules.
